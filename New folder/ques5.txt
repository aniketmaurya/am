#Tower Shower

There are 3 towers and there are n disks stacked on the first towers (Each disk has different diameter). The disk with largest diameter is placed at the bottom and disk with smallest diameter is placed on the top (diameter reducing from bottom to top)

Line 2 contains the name of initial tower (tower 1) [string]

Line 3 contains the name of destination tower (tower 2) [string]

Line 4 contains the name of intermediate tower (tower 3) [string]
